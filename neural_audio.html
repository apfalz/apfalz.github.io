<p class="worksParagraph">One of my favorite pieces of audio generated by my neural network seems to have been produced by an extremely low-frequency but high-amplitude sound. It seems like at some point in the process, amplitudes with an absolute value higher than 1 were folded back down. The audio produced features intricate symmetrical patterns that seem best explained by this process. For this piece I was inspired by the cannons of Conlon Nancarrow. I made two instruments which were modulated by the audio I generated with my neural network. The speeds of the modulators were extremely close, but not exactly the same. The effect is that the two voices gradually diverge from each other over the course of the piece. Contrapuntally they appear at first to be mimicking each other, then later the relationship becomes increasingly difficult to perceive, even though the two are playing almost identical material.</p>

  <p class="worksParagraph"><b>Emergence</b><br>fixed media<br>2016</p>
  <p class="worksParagraph">Working on this project I have spent much of my time pondering extremely short clips of audio. I noticed a constant tension between focusing on the tiniest of details and larger scale changes. I was also very aware of an inherent irony: that the most promising results were only interesting to me because I listened to so many useless results before hearing the ones that actually resembled any inputs. There was also an uneasiness that arose because it was difficult for me to know what the neural network was producing and what I was reading into it. I became fascinated by the emergence of recognizable audio features from the morass of noisy signals and the way that one&#39;s perception changes over time when listening to very similar sounds over and over. </p>

  <p class="worksParagraph"><b>RI0</b><br>fixed media<br>2016</p>
  <p class="worksParagraph">For this piece I was inspired by the serial approach to composition. I began by choosing three different timbres that the network produced. I modulated these signals by a particularly interesting short bit of information generated by the network. It was fascinating to see how it was not quite noise and still not quite periodic. I then passed each channel through a bandstop filter. The filter&#39;s frequency was being controlled by reading through the modulator signal as a serial composer would read through a tone row:  forward (prime form); backwards (retrograde); multiplied by -1 (inverse); and the reverse multiplied by -1 (retrograde inversion). </p>
